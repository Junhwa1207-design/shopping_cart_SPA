<p> 
This is a digital storefront app of the Home Depot website that is possible to choose products and move to a cart. It is also possible to remove and add products as well as filter products based on category.
There is a search bar, shopping cart and a product category button on the top of the section in the side banner.  whenever the user clicks the product category button, it shows up in three categories on the drop-down section. And a user can see each category of products on the main screen.
Once the user clicks the product name, it shows the pop-up window of the cart. And users can check the more specific information of the product including the total price and product video that streamed from the back-end part on the pop-up window.</p>
